Where the magic starts

This "Hello World" repository, as the description refers, is a way I expect to keep me on track with studies, ideas, resources and future contacts with other developers... where the magic starts!

I'm a begginer, currently enrolling "Full Stack Web Development" on Coursera composed by 6 courses:
  - HTML, CSS and JavaScript
  - Front-End Web UI Frameworks and Tools
  - Front-End JavaScript Frameworks: AngularJS
  - Multiplatform Mobile App Development with Web Technologies
  - Server-side Development with NodeJS
  - Full Stack Web Development Specialization Capstone Project

My goal with GitHub is to store all of small projects and pieces of code I'll be learning in the next months, and with that send them to my future lucky boss.

Wish me luck!
